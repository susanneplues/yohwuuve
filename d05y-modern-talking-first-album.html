Ever since the beginner's guides have been posted to the subreddit, I really wanted to write one up for Northlane. I discovered them in 2015 when I was starting to get into metalcore. They quickly became my favourite band ever and I have been obsessed with their music ever since. With Northlane's upcoming album "Alien" being released in early August, I thought now is a good time to introduce some people to the band if they haven't heard anything yet. Background This will be (mostly) copied. "Brother Louie" is Modern Talking's first single from their third album, Ready for Romance. It was their fourth consecutive single to top the German Singles Chart, after "You're My Heart, You're My Soul", "You Can Win If You Want" and "Cheri, Cheri Lady".

Hey everyone, since I really like the idea of Beginner's Guides I figured it would be a nice addition to do one for a band that has slowly become a heavyweight of the genre but has a back catalogue that goes far beyond what most people know of them.

Something that I think is pretty great about music in the last 70~ years is that it's pretty easy to make a compelling argument that almost any period could be considered the biggest hotbed of musical innovation and creativity, especially if you're a fan of a particular genre or movement. My first instinct is "the 60s" (1963-1970~). It was the rise of the modern style of rock music, recording innovations rapidly accelerated, and there were many landmark albums released in this period.

I consider it to be modern punk music. The two sound very different, but they came up at the same time in the development of their genre of popular music. Both have a far more stripped down, minimalist, distorted sound. Both are very straight to the point and they share the same ‚Äúpunk‚Äù attitude. Finally, they both appeal well to anxty teens like myself. Of course, classic punk was only popular for about 5 years, but was simply broug.
